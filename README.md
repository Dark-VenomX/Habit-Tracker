# Habit Tracker
 The Habit Tracker Project is a web-based application designed to help users track their habits on a weekly basis. Users can add habits, mark them as done or undone each week, and manage them flexibly. With a user-friendly interface and key features like goal achievement, self-awareness, and accountability, the project caters to individuals seeking to improve their daily routines and achieve personal growth goals. Future enhancements may include reminders, data analysis, and social sharing features to further enhance the user experience.
